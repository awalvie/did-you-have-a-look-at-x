### Goal

The repository started as a way of sharing information and resources that two software enthusiasts came across while browsing the internet. The purpose of this repository is to categorize that information so that they and others can make use of these resources. We encourage others to help us in our effort and contribute resources they find cool and interesting by making pull requests.
